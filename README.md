# Line Up 🎯🔴🔵

**Line Up** is a strategic two-player game inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe with a twist! The game is played on a 3x3 grid and combines simple placement mechanics with a movement phase for added challenge.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Phase 1: Placement
- Two players take turns placing their colored circles on the board.
  - Player 1: 🔴 Red Circle
  - Player 2: 🔵 Blue Circle
- Circles can only be placed in empty squares.
- The goal is to get **three circles in a row** (horizontal or vertical).

### Phase 2: Movement (if no winner after placement)
- Once all 9 squares are filled and no player has won:
  - Players take turns **moving** one of their circles to an **adjacent empty square** (horizontally or vertically).
- The first player to align **three in a row** wins the game.
