The Game Name Line Up

This is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their colored circles (one player uses red, the other blue) in empty squares.
The goal is to get three of your circles in a row, either horizontally or vertically.
If all the spaces are filled without a winner, players then take turns moving one of their circles to an adjacent empty square (horizontally or vertically) until someone wins
by getting three in a row.  It's like a slightly more complex version of tic-tac-toe.
