🎯 Line Up
Line Up is a two-player strategy game inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe — with a twist. Players take turns placing red 🔴 and blue 🔵 circles on a 3x3 grid. The first to line up three in a row (horizontally or vertically) wins. If the grid fills up with no winner, players enter a second phase where they move their pieces one square at a time to try and secure the win.

🎮 How to Play
Place Phase:

Players take turns placing their pieces on empty squares.

The red player 🔴 starts, followed by blue 🔵.

The goal: get three in a row — horizontally or vertically.

Move Phase:

If all spaces are filled and no winner is declared, players take turns moving one of their pieces to an adjacent (up/down/left/right) empty square.

The game continues until someone forms a winning row.
